This is a rootkit developed for Linux Ubuntu 11.04 "Natty Narwhal" by Kevin Gray.
To compile, run "make clean all"
To install the module, run "sudo insmod rootkit.ko"
To remove the module, run "sudo rmmod rootkit.ko"

This rootkit allows for processes to elevate their user privilege to root by calling setreuid with a specific input: setreuid(11111,11111). It does this by swapping the pointer to the original setreuid function in the syscall table with a pointer to my own function.

A test file is included in the examples folder. This can be compiled using gcc setreuid_test.c
